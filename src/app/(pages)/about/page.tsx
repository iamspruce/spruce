        <p>
          I am a web developer with experience in technical writing, committed
          to delivering high-quality work and providing exceptional service and
          support to clients, including international companies.

          <p>
            I&apos;m a seasoned web developer with many years of experience in
            the field. I&apos;m passionate about building clean, functional, and
            visually appealing websites that deliver results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I&apos;ve worked on a wide range of web development
            projects, including e-commerce sites, content management systems,
            and web applications. I specialize in front-end development, but
            I&apos;m also proficient in back-end development and server
            management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from my work as a web developer, I&apos;ve also written many
            technical articles to help students learn web development. Through
            my writing, I&apos;ve been able to help thousands of aspiring
            developers gain a better understanding of web development concepts,
            tools, and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to writing, I&apos;m also an active contributor to
            open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and
            community, and I&apos;m always looking for ways to give back to the
            tech community that has given me so much.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me reading, or exploring new
            technologies. I&apos;m always looking for ways to expand my
            knowledge and stay on the cutting edge of web development.

        <h3 className="h4">Speaking</h3>
        <p>
          I truly enjoy speaking at events and conferences to share my knowledge
          and engage with like-minded individuals. If you're looking for a web
          development speaker for your upcoming event, don't hesitate to reach
          out to me.
